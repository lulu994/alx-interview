# Pascal's Triangle

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing Pascal's Triangle in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct that consists of a triangular array of binomial coefficients. The goal is to create a function that returns a list of lists representing the Pascal’s triangle of a given size.

## Algorithm
The algorithm for generating Pascal's Triangle involves utilizing various Python concepts such as lists and list comprehensions, functions, loops, conditional statements, recursion (optional), arithmetic operations, indexing and slicing, memory management, error and exception handling (optional), efficiency, and optimization.

- Error and Exception Handling (Optional)
- Efficiency and Optimization

By revisiting these concepts, you will be well-prepared to tackle the challenges of implementing Pascal’s Triangle in Python, applying both your mathematical understanding and programming skills to develop an efficient and effective solution.

## Task
### 0. Pascal's Triangle
- Create a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n:
  - Returns an empty list if n <= 0
  - You can assume n will be always an integer

## Usage
You can use the provided `0-main.py` file to test the implementation of the `pascal_triangle` function. Running the script will print the Pascal's triangle for a given input.
